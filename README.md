# task-core

First of all this is just a starter implementation of my idea of how to develop & manage software about which 2 articles were posted on LinkedIn by me. This is like functional programming which I realized after reading about what is functional programming at least from Java 8 perspective. The main purpose of this project is to provide a platform, framework, tool or to promote a methodology which is to write code once and then reuse it via configuration only. Keep things simple by not creating new ways of solving problems which creates new problems of its own. Reuse what we have, keep it as simple as possible just like a POJO approach and still we can create highly stable, configurable, reusable software. I have tried to explain this idea in LinkedIn posts. The URL to my profile is: https://pk.linkedin.com/in/mobasherswl.
